# Benchmarking - Spark

We used Spark to study scalabilty of machine learning algorithms.

An open source dataset,the adult dataset, has been used to predict income, the number of working hours per week and the native country of a person. To do that, we trained different kind of machine learning models using the pyspark library such as linear regression, logistic regression and random forest.
